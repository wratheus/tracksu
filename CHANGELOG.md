# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Profile scores data foundation (best/recent): typed query/page/summary,
  cancellation, modern score parsing and domain failures. Not connected to UI yet.

- Guest-first player lookup by username/ID, optional account menu and own profile.
- Four rulesets for the selected player; rank, accuracy, performance, play count,
  play time, maximum combo and explicit missing-statistics state.
- Memory-only public API credentials, expiry renewal and one controlled 401 retry.
- Localized search/errors/refresh in English and Russian, number formatting.

### Changed

- Profile composition is local: Main, domain/data, Bloc parts, widgets.
- Search/ruleset requests are latest-wins and cancel superseded transport work.
- Refresh preserves content and shows progress/failure; avatars have a fallback
  and bounded decoding, profile content uses one sliver scroll view.
- README describes the current app; completed foundations moved out of the
  active roadmap. Earlier migration commits remain in Git history.

### Fixed

- Ruleset changes no longer switch a searched player to the signed-in account.
- A late refresh cannot restore credentials after logout; storage writes are ordered.
- HTTP timeout covers response-body reading and aborts timed-out requests;
  typed exceptions survive retry instead of being wrapped again.

No release/version bump or store publication is implied. User verification
is pending; automated tests remain deferred.
